# Watcher continuity

The watcher remains intentionally one-shot: one actionable reason closes one watcher cycle.
Must-work continuity now lives above that process boundary instead of depending on the model remembering a re-arm step.

## Ownership

Pi's `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts` and OpenCode's `.opencode/plugins/fm-primary-watch-arm.js` own continuous re-arm after an actionable child close.
Each adapter starts the next arm before delivering the wake prompt, checks current session-lock ownership at launch, preserves one child or scheduled retry at a time, and applies bounded exponential retry after an unexpected or failed close.
A failed follow-up never cancels continuity restoration.
Pi same-process session replacement follows the generation-owner contract in `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts`.
Claude's `.claude/settings.json` Stop `asyncRewake` hook (`bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh`) owns routine tokenless re-arm.
The hook fires on every Stop, and an eligible primary with supervision need admits one home-scoped owner that foregrounds `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` inside the hook-owned process tree.
A numeric session-lock owner that fails the shared `fm_harness_pid_alive` predicate is reclaimed through `bin/fm-lock.sh` before auto-arm state changes, while a live owner, absent lock, or malformed lock keeps the competing hook inert.
The stale-owner claim occurs only after the existing AFK and supervision-need gates pass.
While supervision is still needed and away mode remains inactive, an actionable close or typed failure wakes the idle session through exit 2.

## Actionable wake ordering

After an actionable Pi or OpenCode child close, the adapter starts and verifies one singleton successor before it delivers the original wake.
It waits at most one readiness timeout per attempt, then sends TERM and waits a bounded retirement confirmation before the next lock-verified exponential retry.
If the unready arm does not retire within that bound, the adapter keeps ownership, starts no overlapping retry, and delivers the typed fallback immediately.
When that retained arm later closes, its actual close is classified as a new supervised event without replaying the earlier fallback.
After the configured retry bound is exhausted, it delivers the original wake with a typed continuity-restoration failure even if every successor arm hung without reporting readiness.
This is deliberate Option B ordering: the fleet is protected before the model handles the wake whenever restoration succeeds, but the model is never left blind when it does not.

Claude's Stop hook starts the successor arm at the next Stop after the handling turn, rather than before notification as Pi and OpenCode do.
The durable wake queue preserves actionable events during the residual active-turn window, and the unchanged bounded turn-end guard enforces recovery at Stop when no watcher or auto-arm claim is present.
No PreToolUse hook denies fleet commands based on watcher status.
The model no longer re-arms after ordinary wakes.
Terminal arm-output classification (`started`, `attached`, or `FAILED`) remains defense in depth for the manual recovery path.
Codex retains its bounded foreground checkpoint protocol.
Grok retains its tracked background-task notification protocol.
No adapter starts a replacement with shell `&`.

The turn-end guard remains the final backstop rather than the normal continuity mechanism and cooperates with the auto-arm in its `--claude` mode.

## Arm-layer cycle contract

`bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` never returns a clean empty success from an owned cycle.
An actionable child output returns that reason normally.
A zero/empty child return rechecks the home lock and beacon, attaches to a verified healthy successor when one exists, or emits `watcher: FAILED - cycle ended without an actionable reason` and exits nonzero.

An attached arm follows verified identity-matched successors, but its outcome depends on whether supervision is genuinely absent rather than on whether that arm personally saw the wake reason, because the owning arm consumes and prints it.
Before reporting the typed failure it accepts three pieces of durable evidence that the cycle ended normally: the wake queue advanced during the cycle, so the owning arm is relaying that reason; this home no longer needs supervision at all; or a live Stop auto-arm claim held by a process other than this arm's own launcher already owns the next cycle.
Any of those exits 0 quietly and records the classification in the lifecycle ledger as `attached-cycle-explained` with the deciding evidence in the successor field, which keeps a real unexplained cycle end distinguishable from a normal one.
A claim held by this arm's own launcher is deliberately excluded: it says nothing about the next cycle, so honoring it would let a genuine outage close quietly.
This is what the Claude ordering above requires - the successor arms at the next Stop, so an attached arm that waited for one would report a certainty, not a race.
That quiet clean-empty exit is a confirmed success on the Claude Stop-hook path specifically, which is the path that reads the arm's exit and output directly.
Pi's and OpenCode's close handlers still classify a clean empty close of an arm child as a typed continuity failure, so an explained attached cycle is still reported as a supervision failure on those two primaries.
That classification is unchanged from before this change rather than something introduced by it, and aligning those two adapters with this contract is separate work.

`--restart` refuses to kill a watcher it can verify as healthy and attaches to it instead, reporting `watcher: restart declined pid=<N>`.
Killing a healthy watcher costs a live supervision cycle and makes the arm that owned it report a typed failure, so an unconditional restart aimed at a working watcher manufactures the alarm it was meant to repair.
`--restart --force` remains available for a deliberate replacement.
Pi's and OpenCode's `--restart` re-arm from a child close is unaffected, because their previous watcher has already exited by then.

The arm layer appends one tab-separated record per observed cycle to `state/.watch-cycle-exits.log`.
Each record includes arm and watcher PIDs, start and end timestamps, exit code and signal, classified reason, beacon age, lock identity before and after close, and successor disposition.
The file is size-capped through `FM_WATCH_CYCLE_LOG_MAX_BYTES` and `FM_WATCH_CYCLE_LOG_KEEP_LINES`.
`state/.watch-triage.log` remains only the watcher's bounded absorbed-wake debug log and carries no lifecycle semantics.

The default 300-second grace is unchanged.
Only the watcher process touches `state/.last-watcher-beat`; no helper process can make a wedged watcher appear healthy.

## Regression coverage

`tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh` checks Pi's first-cycle-or-explicit-repair tool metadata and ownership-based redundant-call no-ops, then simulates actionable and empty child closes against the actual Pi and OpenCode close handlers, blocks prompt delivery to prove the successor launches first, verifies single-flight behavior, changes the session lock before close to prove ownership is rechecked, and hangs each successor arm to prove bounded fallback delivery includes the typed restoration failure.
The same suite covers ordinary same-process session replacement for `/new`, `/resume`, and `/fork`, same-instance shutdown-plus-start, stale prior-generation callbacks, repeated transitions with exactly one live cycle, disappearance of the shutting-down refusal after a valid replacement activates, and terminal quit still refusing late rearm.
`tests/fm-watcher-lock.test.sh` covers verified-successor attach, the typed self-eviction failure, bounded and successor-linked lifecycle rows, and a SIGSTOP counterfactual that distinguishes a live PID from a stale beacon before classifying termination.
It also covers the attached arm's outcome contract: two arms plus one actionable wake produce no failure from the attached arm, an idle home closes quietly, a foreign auto-arm claim accounts for a cycle end while this arm's own launcher does not, and `--restart` declines a verified healthy watcher unless `--force` is passed.
`tests/fm-subagent-pretool-check.test.sh` proves Claude retains only the non-status Bash seatbelts.
`tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.test.sh` covers the auto-arm's scope, stale and live session owners, unchanged AFK and need boundaries, single-flight, and exit-2 translation.
`FM_CLAUDE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm-live-e2e.test.sh` starts with the reproduced stale-lock state, runs session start first, completes two tokenless cycles, and checks the competing-live-owner negative control.
`tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh` covers the cooperative `--claude` guard.

## Active limits and verification

The goal is continuity without a Pi or OpenCode model-memory re-arm step.
No zero-latency guarantee is claimed because lock verification, watcher startup, and bounded retry delays remain deliberate safety work.
OpenCode support targets persistent TUI sessions rather than headless `opencode run`.
Claude depends on the Stop `asyncRewake` rewake, Grok retains native background-completion notifications, and Codex retains bounded foreground checkpoints.

[`verification/supervision.md`](verification/supervision.md#watcher-continuity) records the current five-harness live evidence, the 2026-07-24 Stop-owned Claude auto-arm results, and exact opt-in commands.
