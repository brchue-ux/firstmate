# Primary turn-end supervision guard

This is the authoritative current contract for the "no turn ends blind" primary backstop referenced from AGENTS.md section 8.
The predicate lives in `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh`.
Primary scope lives in `bin/fm-primary-scope-lib.sh`, shared with the native session-start nudge in [`sessionstart-nudge.md`](sessionstart-nudge.md).
Harness hook files adapt each enabled primary harness integration's turn-end mechanism to that shared predicate.

Related PreToolUse guards deny unsafe commands before execution rather than detecting a blind turn end afterward.
Their separate owners are [`arm-pretool-check.md`](arm-pretool-check.md), [`cd-guard.md`](cd-guard.md), and [`subagent-guard.md`](subagent-guard.md).
Do not infer this guard's scope, loop safety, or compatibility tradeoffs for those guards.

## Current invariant

`bin/fm-guard.sh` is a pull-based warning that runs only when another supervision command invokes it.
The turn-end guard closes the remaining gap at the primary's own turn boundary.
When work is in flight and no identity-matched watcher has a fresh beacon, the harness integration must either block the turn end or force one bounded follow-up that uses the recovery instruction from the emitted session-start protocol.
The guard remains a backstop; [`watcher-continuity.md`](watcher-continuity.md) owns normal continuity.

## Shared predicate

The guard first calls the shared primary scope.
A secondmate home runs its own primary Firstmate session, so a genuine `.fm-secondmate-home` marker includes it whether the home is a linked worktree or plain clone.
The marker must be a regular non-symlink file whose whitespace-stripped first line is a non-empty identifier containing only letters, digits, dots, underscores, and dashes.
An unmarked checkout or invalid marker falls through to the git-dir check.
That check keeps crewmate and scout linked worktrees inert because their git dir differs from their git common dir.
It also requires `AGENTS.md`, `bin/`, and the effective state directory.

For an in-scope primary, the guard counts in-flight work from `state/*.meta`.
The default cross-harness mode exits silently with no work in flight.
Claude's `--claude` mode also treats `state/x-watch.check.sh` as supervision need, so X-mode relay polling remains guarded without an in-flight task.
Otherwise it calls `fm_watcher_healthy <state-dir> <watch-path> [grace-seconds] [home]` from `bin/fm-wake-lib.sh`, the same identity-matched lock and fresh-beacon check used by `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`.
A stale beacon blocks even when a watcher pid is live.
A fresh leftover beacon blocks when the lock is missing, dead, or identity-mismatched.

`FM_STATE_OVERRIDE` wins over `FM_HOME/state`, and `FM_HOME` wins over repository-root `state/`.
`FM_HOME` itself resolves through `bin/fm-home-anchor-lib.sh` ([configuration.md](configuration.md#fm_home)); when that resolution refuses because it cannot say which home this session belongs to, the guard exits 0 rather than guarding a turn against another home's state.
`FM_GUARD_GRACE` controls beacon freshness and defaults to 300 seconds.
If `jq` is missing or hook stdin is empty, the guard exits 0 because it cannot safely read loop-guard fields.

## Harness integrations

- Claude registers two `Stop` hooks in `.claude/settings.json`, both anchored through `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`: `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh --claude`, and `bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh` with `asyncRewake: true` and `timeout: 28800`.
- Codex registers a `Stop` hook in `.codex/hooks.json`, anchors the executable to the hook process working directory, verifies a Firstmate-shaped hook-bearing root, and passes the original payload to the shared guard.
- OpenCode listens for `session.idle` in `.opencode/plugins/fm-primary-turnend-guard.js`, lets the watcher coordinator act first, and calls `client.session.promptAsync` once when the guard returns 2.
- Pi listens for `agent_settled` in `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts`, runs once per logical agent run, and calls `pi.sendUserMessage(..., { deliverAs: "followUp" })` once when the guard returns 2.
- Grok registers a `Stop` hook in `.grok/hooks/fm-primary-turnend-guard.json` and delegates capability selection to `bin/fm-turnend-guard-grok.sh`.
  The tracked Claude Stop entries are inert when `GROK_AGENT` is present, so Grok's Claude-compatible settings loading cannot create a second continuation path.

Claude and Codex can block a Stop directly with exit status 2 and stderr.
Both payloads carry `stop_hook_active`.
In the default Codex mode, a true value lets the second stop finish after one forced continuation.

Claude runs the guard with `--claude`, which ignores `stop_hook_active` and cooperates with the Stop-owned auto-arm.
Claude Code sets `stop_hook_active=true` on every stop after any stop-hook continuation, including `asyncRewake` rewakes, which re-opened the 2026-07-21 blind window under the default one-shot behavior.
The Claude mode waits up to `FM_CLAUDE_AUTOARM_SYNC_WAIT_MS` (default 800 milliseconds) and allows the stop when the watcher is healthy, `state/.claude-autoarm.lock` has a live owner, or `state/.claude-autoarm-epoch` contains a fresh rewake outcome.
When none of those proofs appears, it re-blocks up to `FM_CLAUDE_TURNEND_BLOCK_BUDGET` times (default 3, below Claude's 8-block override), then allows degraded with a visible `systemMessage`.
Any allow resets the budget.

Both Claude `Stop` entries are dispatched together, not in sequence.
A blocking exit from the guard does not suppress the `asyncRewake` auto-arm registered after it, so the cooperative split above depends on array order for readability only, never for correctness.
The single-flight owner lock `state/.claude-autoarm.lock` is what bounds concurrency: Claude Code fires one auto-arm process per stop with no deduplication, exactly one claims the lock and translates its cycle, and every other firing exits 0.

The auto-arm acts only for the session that holds `state/.lock`, so a competing session in the same home never arms or rewakes.
One situation looks identical to a competing session and is not one.
A Claude session can be re-hosted: the same conversation keeps running while the process that executes its turns changes, and the process that originally took the lock stays alive as a client that no longer runs anything for this home.
A daemon-hosted background session, a respawned `bg-spare` worker, and an in-place version upgrade all produce that shape.
Ancestry then resolves to a pid the lock does not name while the recorded pid is still a live harness, so before this was handled the auto-arm went inert for the rest of the session, the guard blocked every turn, and each manual repair fixed exactly one turn.
`bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh` owns the distinction through the re-host record `state/.lock-session`, which names the session id that owned the home the last time ancestry and the lock agreed together with the lock pid at that moment.
A live owner is re-anchored through `bin/fm-lock.sh --adopt-session <session-id>` only when the record names the current payload's session id and still names the current lock pid, so a different session can never present it and a record describing a situation that has moved on proves nothing.
The auto-arm refreshes the record on every firing that wins the single-flight claim, which is how a session id that changes while ancestry is intact, such as after a compaction, is picked up within one turn end.
Two situations therefore still reach the guard rather than self-healing: a session id that changes during the one window where ancestry is already broken, and a home where the lock genuinely belongs to a second live firstmate session.
Both are conditions to report, not to re-arm through, which is why the guard names them.
Without `jq`, or with an unusable payload session id, the proof is simply unavailable and the ownership gate is exactly as strict as it was before.

The guard's own decision never consults that record.
On the blocking path only, it reads `state/.lock` and names a live recorded owner that is not this session, because that condition makes re-arming by hand a repair that lasts one turn and the loop otherwise carries no explanation of itself.

OpenCode, Pi, and pi-signed expose passive callbacks for this purpose.
Their adapters fail open at the hook boundary to protect the user session but schedule one bounded follow-up when the predicate blocks.
The generated prompts use the canonical `turn-end-guard` kind after the U+2063 `FIRSTMATE_OP: ` prefix, so Ahoy does not treat them as captain messages.
Each passive adapter owns a loop latch.
Pi keeps the latch across internal tool turns and clears it only when the generated follow-up settles or delivery fails.
OpenCode's forced follow-up is supported for persistent TUI sessions and remains fail-open in headless `opencode run`.

Grok makes exactly one typed capability decision from each running Stop payload.
A boolean `stopHookActive` selects native blocking, including both false on the initial stop and true on the bounded continuation.
The camel-case field has precedence when both spellings appear; when it is absent, a boolean `stop_hook_active` selects the same native path for compatibility.
The native path returns the shared guard's status and stderr to the same Grok process and never starts `grok --resume`.
When both capability spellings are absent, the adapter preserves one pre-native `grok --resume` fallback guarded by `GROK_TURNEND_GUARD_ACTIVE` and intentionally omits `--permission-mode`.
Malformed JSON, a selected field with a non-boolean type, missing `jq`, missing hook prerequisites, or an already-active legacy guard allows the stop without starting either continuation path.
Grok's project hook requires the checkout to be trusted with `/hooks-trust` or launch-time `--trust`; genuine pre-native builds can run the same tracked hook from an isolated global hook directory.

If a passive adapter cannot invoke its SDK, or the Grok legacy fallback cannot find `grok` or a session id, the next pull-based `fm-guard.sh` call reports the problem.
That warning uses `bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh --repair-line`, so it always points to the active harness protocol rather than embedding another repair command.

## Compatibility limits

- Child crewmate and scout worktrees are outside scope.
- A valid secondmate home is in scope; an idle secondmate endpoint with no X-mode relay poll remains healthy because it has no supervision need.
- The direct-blocking and bounded passive-follow-up split is limited to the primary integrations listed above.
- OpenCode headless mode and untrusted Grok project hooks remain fail-open at the host boundary.
- Kimi Code CLI 0.29.1 exposes only global `[[hooks]]` configuration in `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`, including a `Stop` event with snake_case payload fields `hook_event_name`, `session_id`, `cwd`, and `stop_hook_active`.
- Kimi has no project-level hook configuration and remains outside the primary guard integrations above.
- Captain-approved Kimi crew wake support uses `bin/fm-kimi-turnend-hook.sh` to edit only one marker-delimited Firstmate region in that global config and install a silent always-zero hook.
- The hook remains inert unless the payload `cwd` contains a per-task token pointer that resolves through Firstmate's private registry to one `state/<id>.turn-ended` marker.
- Installation refuses before writing unless `python3` with `tomllib` and `jq` are available.
- If `jq` is removed after installation, the hook remains silent and exits 0, turn-end wakes stop, and Kimi crews fall back to idle detection.
- Unreadable hook input remains fail-open.
- No harness adapter uses a shell ampersand to manufacture supervision.
