# Safe, home-scoped (re-)arm of the firstmate watcher, with honest verification.
#
# The watcher (bin/fm-watch.sh) blocks until it has an actionable wake to
# surface, then prints one reason line and exits. While state/.afk exists the
# daemon owns triage and the watcher exits on every wake for the daemon to
# classify. Reliability depends on arming through a mechanism that SURVIVES the
# call and NOTIFIES on exit, so firstmate must run this script as the harness's
# own tracked background task (e.g. run_in_background), or - for a Claude
# primary - inside the Stop asyncRewake hook's foreground process tree
# (bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh), where the harness owns the process group and
# the hook's exit-2 rewake is the notification. Run it as its own standalone
# background task, never bundled onto the tail of another command.
# NEVER fire it and forget with a shell `&` inside another call: that backgrounded
# child is reaped when the call returns, leaving NO watcher running and a false
# "already running" off the dying process. That exact mistake silently took
# supervision down for ~30 minutes.
# On a harness with a PreToolUse-equivalent hook, bin/fm-arm-pretool-check.sh
# applies the command-position policy before the command runs; see
# docs/arm-pretool-check.md for the blessed tree and deny reason codes. It is a
# pre-execution seatbelt, not a substitute for the verification here.
#
# This script forks the watcher as a tracked child, then VERIFIES the outcome
# before it settles in. It confirms a watcher process is genuinely alive AND the
# liveness beacon (state/.last-watcher-beat) is fresh within FM_GUARD_GRACE (the
# single source of truth, shared with fm-watch.sh and fm-guard.sh), and prints
# exactly one unambiguous status line:
#   watcher: started pid=<N> (beacon fresh)              - it launched one and confirmed it
#   watcher: attached pid=<N> (beacon <age>s)            - a live+fresh successor holds the lock;
#                                                          this arm attaches and follows it
#   watcher: restart declined pid=<N> (beacon <age>s)    - --restart found a verified healthy
#                                                          watcher and attached instead of killing it
#   watcher: FAILED - no live watcher with a fresh beacon  - could not confirm one
#   watcher: FAILED - cycle ended without an actionable reason
#                                                        - a clean cycle ended with no wake, no
#                                                          verified healthy successor, and nothing
#                                                          else accounting for supervision
# It NEVER reports started/attached/healthy off a stale beacon or a dead/reused pid: a
# stale-beacon or dead-pid holder either self-heals (the fresh child steals the
# dead lock per the singleton self-eviction/steal path and is confirmed) or this
# returns the FAILED line. On started it waits the child and propagates the wake
# reason; on attached it stays live across identity-matched successors. A cycle
# that ends with no reason line and no healthy successor is resolved against the
# watcher's identity-bound delivery record: a matching record reports that wake
# and exits 0. Neither is ever a clean empty completion. On FAILED it exits
# non-zero so the failure is loud. A live cycle already present means re-arm
# attaches - do not start a second watcher.
#
# An ATTACHED arm cannot see the wake reason, because the OWNING arm consumes and
# prints it. When the delivery record does not account for the cycle either, the
# outcome still depends on whether supervision is genuinely absent, not on
# whether this particular arm personally saw the reason: before reporting the
# typed cycle-end failure it checks the durable evidence that the cycle is
# accounted for - this home no longer needs supervision at all, or a live Stop
# auto-arm claim that is not this arm's own launcher already owns the next
# cycle. Either is a normal cycle end and exits 0 quietly. This matters because
# Claude's Stop hook arms the successor at the NEXT Stop
# (docs/watcher-continuity.md), so a successor is not merely unlikely inside the
# confirmation window - it is guaranteed absent, which turned every observed
# attached cycle end into a false FAILED. An advanced wake-queue counter is
# deliberately NOT such evidence; the delivery record above is the watcher-bound
# form of that claim, and the counter is home-wide.
#
# Every observed watcher cycle appends one tab-separated lifecycle record to
# state/.watch-cycle-exits.log. The arm layer owns that bounded ledger; it records
# arm/watcher identities, timestamps, exit/signal classification, beacon age,
# lock identity before and after close, and successor disposition. The separate
# state/.watch-triage.log remains exclusively the watcher's absorbed-wake debug
# log and is never written here.
#
# --restart: stop ONLY this FM_HOME's watcher (the pid recorded in THIS home's
# state/.watch.lock) and own a fresh cycle, or attach if a verified live peer
# wins the singleton while the duplicate child stands down. It
# resolves and signals exactly that pid, so it can never touch another home's
# watcher. NEVER `pkill -f
# bin/fm-watch.sh`: that pattern matches every firstmate home's watcher
# (secondmate homes run the same script) and would kill siblings.
# It also refuses to kill a watcher this script can VERIFY as healthy: killing
# one costs a real supervision cycle and makes the arm that owned it report a
# typed failure, so a restart aimed at a working watcher manufactures the very
# alarm it was meant to repair. Without --force, a verified healthy holder is
# attached to exactly as a plain arm would. Adapters that re-arm from a child
# close (Pi, OpenCode) are unaffected: their previous watcher has already exited,
# so there is nothing healthy to decline.
#
# --force: only with --restart, and only to deliberately replace a watcher that
# is verifiably alive - for example when its behavior, not its liveness, is the
# problem. Never use it to silence a repeated failure report.
