# fm-test-run.sh - single owner of Firstmate's behavior-test runner, lane
# composition for portable CI shards, local --jobs for the proven-isolated set,
# timing markers, and the complete-regression coverage guard.
#
# Selection modes (exactly one of: --all, --family, --changed, --lane,
# --proven-isolated, or script paths):
#   fm-test-run.sh --all
#   fm-test-run.sh --family <name>
#   fm-test-run.sh --changed [--base <git-ref>]
#   fm-test-run.sh --lane portable-parallel-1|portable-parallel-2|portable-serial
#   fm-test-run.sh --proven-isolated
#   fm-test-run.sh tests/<name>.test.sh [more scripts...]
#
# Inspection (no execution):
#   fm-test-run.sh --list --all
#   fm-test-run.sh --list --family <name>
#   fm-test-run.sh --list --lane portable-parallel-1
#   fm-test-run.sh --list-families
#   fm-test-run.sh --list-lanes
#   fm-test-run.sh --check-coverage
#
# Aggregation (no suite execution):
#   fm-test-run.sh --aggregate-json <out.json> <lane.json> [more lane.json...]
#
# Options:
#   --json <path>   write a deterministic timing artifact after the run
#   --list          print selected script paths (one per line) and exit 0
#   --base <ref>    with --changed, compare against this ref (default: origin/main)
#   --exclude-family <name>
#                   drop scripts whose primary family matches <name> after selection
#                   (repeatable; portable CI lanes exclude real-herdr-gated so the
#                   dedicated required Herdr lane owns that coverage)
#   --fail-on-gate-skip <token>
#                   after each script, fail the run if any output line contains
#                   "skip: <token>" (e.g. --fail-on-gate-skip 'herdr not found').
#                   The required Herdr CI lane uses this so a missing pin cannot
#                   silently pass as a gate skip.
#   --jobs N        run the selected scripts with up to N concurrent workers.
#                   Default is 1 (serial). N>1 is allowed only when every
#                   selected script is in the proven-isolated set
#                   (bin/fm-test-isolation-proof.sh --list). Cap is 8. Stateful
#                   families never schedule under --jobs.
#   -h, --help      print this header
#
# Fixture containment:
#   Every executed script runs with TMPDIR and TMP pointed at a private
#   directory inside this run's own root, so a fixture built the way the suite
#   builds them - mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/fm-<prefix>.XXXXXX", directly or
#   through tests/lib.sh fm_test_tmproot - lands inside the run instead of
#   beside it. Each script's private root is removed as soon as that script
#   finishes, and the run root is removed on normal exit and on INT, TERM, HUP,
#   or QUIT. This is the single owner of fixture cleanup: no test file needs its
#   own EXIT trap for temp roots, and an interrupted run cleans up too. /tmp is
#   a tmpfs on some hosts, where a leaked fixture is leaked RAM, not disk.
#   FM_TASK_TMP_ROOT is pointed at the same private directory, so a test that
#   drives a real bin/fm-spawn.sh keeps its per-task scratch root inside the run
#   instead of leaving a /tmp/fm-<fixture id>/ that no teardown will ever claim.
#
# Orphan reap:
#   An executing run first reaps fixture directories orphaned by earlier runs
#   that were killed outright (SIGKILL leaves no trap to run), so a host that
#   already leaked heals on the next test run. bin/fm-tmp-sweep.sh is the single
#   owner of which directories are safe to remove and of every refusal that
#   protects a live task, an in-use directory, or an operational home; this
#   runner supplies only the candidate cap a test host wants, the homes this
#   checkout can see, and the horizons below. Read that script's header for the
#   full contract.
#
#   The reap runs as two passes. The first is scoped by name to fm-test-run.*,
#   the run roots this runner alone creates, on a short window: SIGKILL runs no
#   trap, so the reap is the only thing that reclaims a killed run, and every
#   fixture is nested inside that root. The second uses the sweep's own
#   conservative window over everything else, because the shared root also holds
#   scratch belonging to live firstmate tooling that can sit unwritten far
#   longer than a fixture. No tool has to register itself to stay out of the
#   short window; it cannot reach a name this runner did not create.
#   FM_TEST_REAP_ROOT (default /tmp), FM_TEST_REAP_MIN_AGE_SECONDS (default 900,
#   rounded up to whole minutes, and applied only to the first pass),
#   FM_TEST_REAP_MAX (default 500), and FM_TEST_REAP_HOMES (extra
#   colon-separated Firstmate homes whose state/*.meta to read) exist so this
#   behavior is testable without touching the host's real /tmp.
#   FM_TEST_RUN_ACTIVE=1 is exported to every executed script and suppresses the
#   reap in a nested run.
#
# Per-script machine-parseable markers (stdout):
#   FM_TEST_BEGIN <iso8601> <script> family=<family> expected_gate_skip=<class>
#   FM_TEST_END <iso8601> <script> exit=<code> duration_ms=<n> gate_skip=<true|false>
#
# Reap marker (stdout, once, executing runs only, and never when the sweep
# refused as a whole):
#   FM_TEST_REAP root=<dir> removed=<n>
#
# After all scripts (stdout):
#   FM_TEST_SUMMARY total=<n> failed=<n> skipped_gate=<n> duration_ms=<n>
#   FM_TEST_SUMMARY_FAMILY family=<name> count=<n> duration_ms=<n> failed=<n>
#   FM_TEST_SLOWEST rank=<k> script=<path> duration_ms=<n>
#
# Exit status is non-zero if any selected script exits non-zero or a configured
# --fail-on-gate-skip token appears. Other gate skips (first meaningful line
# matching ^skip:) remain successful and are counted as skipped_gate.
#
# Family labels, the changed-file map, and production portable-shard composition
# live in this script only (one owner). The proven-isolated candidate set remains
# owned by bin/fm-test-isolation-proof.sh; portable parallel shards are a
# duration-balanced partition of that exact set (see docs/fm-test-portable-shards.md).
# --changed is conservative: it over-selects related families rather than
# under-selecting, and never expands to the complete suite unless --all.
